								<h3>THANK YOU!</h3>
								<p>All of NOVAdance would like to thank our generous supporters for making 2016’s event so successful.
									Because of your small and large donations we were able to make a significant impact on the lives of many.</p>

								<p>In our first year we faced countless obstacles but we persevered.
									Dedicated to “Ignite Change” we worked around the clock to create the best event possible.  In 2017 we hope to surpass this success.</p>

								<p>Villanova’s alumni network is one of the top in the nation’s.  For a reason.
										Our four years at Nova are far too short; there are too many things to learn, great causes to rally behind, and fun times to be had.
										During our short tenure at Villanova we are determined to see NOVAdance grow to become a cornerstone of Villanova.  To do this we need your help.</p>

								<p>Nova has always been a place where anything was possible.  A nationer can do anything with the help of the fellow Villlanovan, both current and graduated.  There are many reasons to donate
										<li>Every three minutes a family hears “your child has cancer”</li>
										<li>1 in 285 people born will be diagnosed with cancer before they turn 20</li>
										<li>These are innocent children. Their childhood isn't being robbed from them because of poor lifestyle choices, just poor luck.</li></p>

								<p>In addition to all these reasons, this is the chance to significantly shape the Villanova environment for decades to come.
									Any donation size will help establish NOVAdance as a major event on campus, allowing you, a Nova grad who wishes they could return,
									a chance to make an impact on campus and help children afflicted with such a terrible disease.</p>
